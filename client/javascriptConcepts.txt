Great! Here are JavaScript project ideas you can implement in your current PlayNext project to practice and demonstrate key JavaScript concepts often asked in interviews:

1. DOM Manipulation
Add a new game dynamically to the "Featured Games" section using a form.
Implement a "Show More/Less" button for game descriptions.

2. Event Handling
Add click events to navigation links to highlight the active section.
Show/hide the login form on button click.

3. Form Validation
Validate the login form fields (e.g., check for empty fields, password strength) before submission using JavaScript.

4. Local Storage / Session Storage
Save the last logged-in username and auto-fill it next time.
Store favorite games and display them in a new section.

5. Fetch API / AJAX
Fetch a list of games or news from a mock API (e.g., jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and display them.

6. ES6+ Features
Use arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and spread/rest operators in your scripts.

7. Promises & Async/Await
Fetch trailers or news asynchronously and handle loading/error states.

8. Closures & Callbacks
Implement a simple counter or timer using closures.
Use callbacks for handling user actions.

9. Object-Oriented Programming
Create a Game class to manage game data and methods (like render, rate, etc.).

10. Array Methods
Filter, sort, and map the games array to display different views (e.g., top-rated, by genre).

How to start:
Create a new file script.js in your src folder and link it in your index.html:

Let me know which concept you want to start with, and I can provide a step-by-step implementation!
